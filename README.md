Description: Procedually generated islands with flag marker.

Artist Statement: I struggled with coming up with an idea that could realistically work with the automatic tiling feature, and after trial and error I ended up with these islands. I think I achieved my goal, and I really like the islands that I was able to create. I think there could be optimizations in the code, but I'm not too worried about that. The challenge was creating something that looked good from the noise function, so when I selected colors for the tiles I figured that they already looked somewhat like islands, so my objective was to take the generated land and add logic to its generation, creating sand banks that resemble beaches.
